Key Concepts:

1. Thinking Systems:
- System 1: Fast, automatic (current LLMs)
- System 2: Slow, deliberate (future goal)

2. Crew AI Implementation:
```python
from crew_ai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Create agents
researcher = Agent(
    role="Market Researcher",
    goal="Analyze market demand",
    backstory="Expert in market analysis"
)

# Define tasks
task = Task(
    description="Analyze market potential",
    agent=researcher
)

# Create crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher],
    tasks=[task]
)
```

3. Tools Integration:
- Built-in tools: Google Search, Wikipedia
- Custom tools: Reddit scraper, Email parser
- Local models support: Llama, Mistral

4. Local Model Performance:
- Best: Llama 13B, OpenChat
- Average: Mistral, OpenHermes
- Poor: Llama 7B, T5

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect or provide more code examples?
